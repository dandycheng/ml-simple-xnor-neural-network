# ml-simple-xnor-neural-network

### The mathematicalexplanation regarding neural network is in the Jupyter file in this repository.
This is a simple neural network that predicts an XNOR gate output.

XNOR gate logic:

```
A | B | Output
---------------
1 | 0 |   0
0 | 1 |   0
0 | 0 |   1
1 | 1 |   1
```
